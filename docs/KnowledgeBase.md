## 1. Platform Overview
FindMyPark is a community-driven smart parking ecosystem. Unlike traditional parking apps that only list commercial lots, FindMyPark enables a peer-to-peer sharing economy where individuals can monetize their unused parking space.

## 2. Smart Features Explained

### 🤖 AI Demand Prediction
Our system uses historical data and real-time event triggers (like cricket matches or concerts) to predict parking availability.
- **Green Indicator**: High probability of finding a spot.
- **Red Indicator**: High demand expected. Suggest booking in advance.

### ⚡ Dynamic Pricing (Surge)
To ensure turnover in high-demand zones, we apply a "Surge" multiplier.
- **Benefit**: This maximizes availability for drivers who urgently need a spot.
- **Transparency**: The surge rate (e.g., 1.2x) is explicitly shown *before* you book. No hidden charges.

### 🔌 EV Charging Grid
We integrate with OCPI-compliant chargers. You can filter spots that have:
- **Level 1**: Standard 3-pin socket (Slow Charge).
- **Level 2**: Dedicated AC Wallbox (Fast Charge).

## 3. Account & Security

### 🔐 Zero-Trust Authentication
We do not use passwords alone.
- **Drivers**: Mobile OTP login for quick access.
- **Hosts**: 2-Factor Authentication (Email + Mock Mobile) for dashboard access.

### 🛡️ Trust & Safety (KYC)
Safety is paramount.
- **Hosts**: Must upload Government ID (Aadhaar/PAN) and Address Proof.
- **Listings**: Every new spot is manually verified by our Admin team before going live.

## 4. Community Guidelines

### For Drivers 🚗
- **Respect the Space**: Do not litter or block other vehicles.

- **Rating**: Rate your host honest to help the community.

### For Hosts 🏠
